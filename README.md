# Carrier-Datasets
This is a dedicated target detection dataset for carrier detection (baby carriages, baby carriages)
# Data set information
The carrier detection image dataset contains RGB images and corresponding labels. The current dataset has 1146 training set images, 327 validation set images and 165 test set images.
Our dataset comes from web data, self-made data, and data selected from publicly available datasets, and the dataset categories contain baby carriages and strollers. In the future, we will gradually enrich the dataset and add the video-based violence detection dataset.

 
# Characterization of the dataset：

   1. baby carriage and stroller training set.
   
   2. baby carriage, stroller validation set.
   
   3.Pram, stroller test set.
   
   4. Multi-scene images.
   
   5. labeled dataset.
 
# Dataset application areas：
Application areas for the dataset include: image-based target detection, stroller detection, cart detection, carrier detection in railroad station scenarios, etc.
